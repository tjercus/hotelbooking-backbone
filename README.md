=====================

Shows some common concepts used when developing a single page application with backbone JS

- use jquery-template to do client side templating
- using a namespace to not pollute the DOM
- simple testing of modules with qunit
- use of an 'application object' instead of a router
- updating views when model objects change
- using jquery custom events to decouple components through an application wide 'eventbus' (pub/sub)
- using a comparator to sort a collection
- using subviews (a list with listitems)
